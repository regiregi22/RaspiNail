### Configuration

Now that LND is installed, we need to configure it to work with Bitcoin Core and run automatically on startup.

* Open a "bitcoin" user session

  ```sh
  $ sudo su - bitcoin
  ```

* Create the LND working directory and the corresponding symbolic link

  ```sh
  $ mkdir /mnt/ext/lnd
  $ ln -s /mnt/ext/lnd /home/bitcoin/.lnd
  $ ls -la
  ```

* Create the LND configuration file and paste the following content (adjust to your alias). Save and exit.

  ```sh
  $ nano /mnt/ext/lnd/lnd.conf
  ```

  ```ini
  # RaspiNail: lnd configuration

## Run LND

Still with user "bitcoin", we first start LND manually to check if everything works fine.

```sh
$ lnd
```

The daemon prints the status information directly to the command line.
This means that we cannot use that session without stopping the server. We need to open a second SSH session.

### Wallet setup

Start your SSH program (eg. PuTTY) a second time, connect to the Pi and log in as "admin".
Commands for the **second session** start with the prompt `$2` (which must not be entered).

Once LND is started, the process waits for us to create the integrated Bitcoin wallet (it does not use the "bitcoind" wallet).

* Start a "bitcoin" user session

  ```sh
  $2 sudo su - bitcoin
  ```

* Create the LND wallet

  ```sh
  $2 lncli create
  ```

* If you want to create a new wallet, enter your `password [C]` as wallet password, select `n` regarding an existing seed and enter the optional `password [D]` as seed passphrase. A new cipher seed consisting of 24 words is created.

These 24 words, combined with your passphrase (optional `password [D]`)  is all that you need to restore your Bitcoin wallet and all Lighting channels. The current state of your channels, however, cannot be recreated from this seed, this requires a continuous backup and is still under development for LND.

üö® This information must be kept secret at all times. **Write these 24 words down manually on a piece of paper and store it in a safe place.** This piece of paper is all an attacker needs to completely empty your wallet! Do not store it on a computer. Do not take a picture with your mobile phone. **This information should never be stored anywhere in digital form.**

* exit "bitcoin" user session

  ```sh
  $2 exit
  ```
  
<script id="asciicast-xv9Gq3G5Pu5A1Jtxu2bACRvjQ" src="https://asciinema.org/a/xv9Gq3G5Pu5A1Jtxu2bACRvjQ.js" async></script>

üí° _In this screencast I use the awesome [`tmux`](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~ckuehl/tmux/){:target="_blank"} to run multiple Terminal sessions in parallel.
But you can just connect to your RaspiNail with two separate SSH sessions._

### Authorization for "admin"

Let's authorize the "admin" user to work with LND using the command line interface `lncli`. For that to work, we need to copy the Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate and the permission files (macaroons) to the admin home folder.

* Check if the TLS certificates (`tls.cert` and `tls.key`) have been created.

  ```sh
  $2 sudo ls -la /mnt/ext/lnd/
  ```

* Check if the permission files `admin.macaroon` has been created.

  ```sh
  $2 sudo ls -la /home/bitcoin/.lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/
  ```

* Link the LND data directory in the user "admin" home.
  As a member or the group "bitcoin", admin has read-only access to certain files.
  We also need to make all directories browsable for the group (with `g+X`) and allow it to read the `admin.macaroon`.

  ```sh
  $2 ln -s /mnt/ext/lnd /home/admin/.lnd
  $2 sudo chmod -R g+X /home/admin/.lnd/data/
  $2 sudo chmod g+r /home/admin/.lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/admin.macaroon
  ```

* Make sure that `lncli` works by unlocking your wallet (enter `password [C]` ) and getting some node infos.

  ```sh
  $2 lncli unlock
  ```

* Check the current state of LND

  ```sh
  $2 lncli getinfo
  ```

You can also see the progress of the initial sync of LND with Bitcoin in the first SSH session.

Let's stop the server for the moment and focus on our primary SSH session again.

```sh
$2 lncli stop
$2 exit
```

This should terminate LND "gracefully" in SSH session 1 that can now be used interactively again.

<script id="asciicast-o7YMV8E3KAWyVXq3VdzATImYX" src="https://asciinema.org/a/o7YMV8E3KAWyVXq3VdzATImYX.js" async></script>

### Autostart on boot

Now, let's set up LND to start automatically on system startup.

* Exit the "bitcoin" user session back to "admin"

  ```sh
  $ exit
  ```

* Create LND systemd unit with the following content. Save and exit.

  ```sh
  $ sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/lnd.service
  ```

  ```ini
  # RaspiNail: systemd unit for lnd
  # /etc/systemd/system/lnd.service

  [Unit]
  Description=LND Lightning Network Daemon
  Wants=bitcoind.service
  After=bitcoind.service

  [Install]
  WantedBy=multi-user.target
  ```

* Enable, start and unlock LND

  ```sh
  $ sudo systemctl enable lnd
  $ sudo systemctl start lnd
  $ systemctl status lnd
  $ lncli unlock
  ```

* Now, the daemon information is no longer displayed on the command line but written into the system journal. You can monitor the LND startup progress until it caught up with the testnet blockchain (about 1.3m blocks at the moment). This can take up to 2 hours, after that you see a lot of very fast chatter (exit with `Ctrl-C`).

  ```sh
  $ sudo journalctl -f -u lnd
  ```

<script id="asciicast-7Kx4HpX5EfwzYmDXBeqVCszk6" src="https://asciinema.org/a/7Kx4HpX5EfwzYmDXBeqVCszk6.js" async></script>

## LND in action

Now your Lightning node is ready.
This is also the point of no return.
Up until now, you can just start over.
Once you send real bitcoin to your RaspiNail, you have "skin in the game".

* Make sure your RaspiNail is working as expected.
* Get a little practice with `bitcoin-cli` and its options (see [Bitcoin Core RPC documentation](https://bitcoin-rpc.github.io/){:target="_blank"})
* Try a few restarts (first stop lnd and bitcoind with `lncli stop`, `sudo systemctl stop lnd`, `sudo systemctl stop bitcoind` and then reboot with `sudo reboot`), is everything starting fine (don't forget to unlock the wallet after each reboot with `lncli unlock`)?

### Funding your Lightning node

* Generate a new Bitcoin address (p2wkh = native SegWit/Bech32) to receive funds on-chain and send a small amount of Bitcoin to it from any wallet of your choice.
  [üïÆ `newaddress`](https://api.lightning.community/#newaddress){:target="_blank"}
  
  ```sh
  $ lncli newaddress p2wkh
  > "address": "bc1..."
  ```

* Check your LND wallet balance
  [üïÆ `walletbalance`](https://api.lightning.community/#walletbalance){:target="_blank"}

  ```sh
  $ lncli walletbalance
  {
      "total_balance": "712345",
      "confirmed_balance": "0",
      "unconfirmed_balance": "712345"
  }
  ```

As soon as your funding transaction is mined (1 confirmation), LND will show its amount as "confirmed_balance".

üí° If you want to open a few channels, you might want to send a few transactions.
If you have only one [UTXO](https://bitcoin.org/en/glossary/unspent-transaction-output), you need to wait for the change to return to your wallet after every new channel opening.

### Opening channels

Although LND features an optional "autopilot", we manually open some channels.
I recommend to go on [Amboss.Space](https://www.amboss.space/){:target="_blank"} or [1ML.com](https://1ml.com){:target="_blank"} and look for a mix of big and small nodes with decent Node Ranks.

To connect to a remote node, you need its URI that looks like `<pubkey>@host`:

* the `<pubkey>` is just a long hexadecimal number, like `03864ef025fde8fb587d989186ce6a4a186895ee44a926bfc370e2c366597a3f8f`
* the `host` can be a domain name, an ip address or a Tor onion address, followed by the port number (usually `:9735`)

Just grab the whole URI above the big QR code and use it as follows (we will use the ACINQ node as an example):

* **Connect** to the remote node, with the full URI.
  [üïÆ `connect`](https://api.lightning.community/#connectpeer){:target="_blank"}

  ```sh
  $ lncli connect 03864ef025fde8fb587d989186ce6a4a186895ee44a926bfc370e2c366597a3f8f@34.239.230.56:9735
  ```

* **Open a channel** using the `<pubkey>` and the channel capacity in satoshis.
  [üïÆ `openchannel`](https://api.lightning.community/#openchannel){:target="_blank"}

  One Bitcoin equals 100 million satoshis, so at $10'000/BTC, $10 amount to 0.001 BTC or 100'000 satoshis.
  To avoid mistakes, you can just use an [online converter](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/satoshi/to-usd/).

  The command as a built-in fee estimator, but to avoid overpaying fees, you can manually control the fees for the funding transaction by using the `sat_per_byte` argument as follows (to select the appropriate fee, in sats/vB, check [mempool.space](https://mempool.space/){:target="_blank"}) 
  ```sh
  $ lncli openchannel --sat_per_vbyte 8 03864ef025fde8fb587d989186ce6a4a186895ee44a926bfc370e2c366597a3f8f 100000 0
  ```

* **Check your funds**, both in the on-chain wallet and the channel balances.
  [üïÆ `walletbalance`](https://api.lightning.community/#walletbalance){:target="_blank"}
  [üïÆ `channelbalance`](https://api.lightning.community/#channelbalance){:target="_blank"}

  ```sh
  $ lncli walletbalance
  $ lncli channelbalance
  ```

* **List active channels**. Once the channel funding transaction has been mined and gained enough confirmations, your channel is fully operational.
  That can take an hour or more.
  [üïÆ `listchannels`](https://api.lightning.community/#listchannels){:target="_blank"}

  ```sh
  $ lncli listchannels
  ```

* **Make a Lightning payment**. These work with invoices, so everytime you buy something or want to send money, you need to get an invoice first.
  To try, why not send me a single satoshi to view my Twitter profile?

  * Click on this paywall link: <https://paywall.link/to/468ad>
  * Click on "Manual Payment Information" and copy the Invoice.
  * Pay me 1 satoshi (~ $0.0001) ü§ë

    ```sh
    * lncli payinvoice lnbc10n1pw......................gsj59
    ```

### More commands

A quick reference with common commands to play around with:

* list all arguments for the CLI (command line interface)

  ```sh
  $ lncli
  ```

* get help for a specific command

  ```sh
  $ lncli help [COMMAND]
  ```

* Find out some general stats about your node:
  [üïÆ `getinfo`](https://api.lightning.community/#getinfo){:target="_blank"}

  ```sh
  $ lncli getinfo
  ```

* Check the peers you are currently connected to:
  [üïÆ `listpeers`](https://api.lightning.community/#listpeers){:target="_blank"}

  ```sh
  $ lncli listpeers
  ```

* Check the status of your pending channels:
  [üïÆ `pendingchannels`](https://api.lightning.community/#pendingchannels){:target="_blank"}

  ```sh
  $ lncli pendingchannels
  ```

* Check the status of your active channels:
  [üïÆ `listchannels`](https://api.lightning.community/#listchannels){:target="_blank"}

  ```sh
  $ lncli listchannels
  ```

* Before paying an invoice, you should decode it to check if the amount and other infos are correct:
  [üïÆ `decodepayreq`](https://api.lightning.community/#decodepayreq){:target="_blank"}

  ```sh
  $ lncli decodepayreq [INVOICE]
  ```

* Pay an invoice:

  ```sh
  $ lncli payinvoice [INVOICE]
  ```
  
* Send a payment to a node without invoice using AMP (both sender and receiver nodes have to have AMP enabled):
  [ÙÄÄÅ `sendpayment`](https://api.lightning.community/#sendpayment){:target="_blank"}

  ```sh
  $ lncli sendpayment --amp --fee_limit 1 --dest=<node_pubkey> --final_cltv_delta=144 --amt=<amount_in_sats> 
  ```
  
* Check the payments that you sent:
  [üïÆ `listpayments`](https://api.lightning.community/#listpayments){:target="_blank"}

  ```sh
  $ lncli listpayments
  ```

* Create an invoice:
  [üïÆ `addinvoice`](https://api.lightning.community/#addinvoice){:target="_blank"}

  ```sh
  $ lncli addinvoice [AMOUNT_IN_SATOSHIS]
  ```

* List all invoices:
  [üïÆ `listinvoices`](https://api.lightning.community/#listinvoices){:target="_blank"}

  ```sh
  $ lncli listinvoices
  ```

* to close a channel, you need the following two arguments that can be determined with `listchannels` and are listed as "channelpoint": `FUNDING_TXID`:`OUTPUT_INDEX`
  [üïÆ `closechannel`](https://api.lightning.community/#closechannel){:target="_blank"}

  ```sh
  $ lncli listchannels
  $ lncli closechannel --sat_per_vbyte <fee> [FUNDING_TXID] [OUTPUT_INDEX]
  ```

* to force close a channel (if your peer is offline or not cooperative), use `--force`

  ```sh
  $ lncli closechannel --force [FUNDING_TXID] [OUTPUT_INDEX]
  ```

## LND upgrade

If you want to upgrade to a new release of LND in the future, check out the FAQ section:
[How to upgrade LND](raspibolt_faq.md#how-to-upgrade-lnd)

## Optional: Using LiT (Lightning Terminal) instead of LND

LiT is a software suite of Lightning Labs which contains LND, Faraday (accounting service), Loop (client software for submarine swaps with LOOP node of Lightning Labs) and Pool (client software to submit orders to buy and sell inbound liquidity through unique price auction at each new block found). LiT provides a user interface to make submarine swap easily, it now also features a UI for Pool Market which is a good tool to estimate the price of liquidity.

Because Pool is alpha software, LiT is alpha software too. The LND part is however in beta and the behavior is exactly the same as LND.

You cannot run LiT and LND at the same time.

The Lightning Terminal UI requires a password. Select a new password:

`[ E ] Master user password`

### Download LiT

LiT has its own configuration file. The settings for LND, Pool, Faraday, Loop can all be put in the LiT configuration file 

* Open a "bitcoin" user session

  ```sh
  $ sudo su - bitcoin
  ```

* Create the LiT working directory

  ```sh
  $ mkdir /home/bitcoin/.lit
  ```
* Create the LiT configuration file and paste the following content (adjust to your alias and paste password [B] as required in the Faraday section). Save and exit.

üîç *Notice that the options for LND, Faraday, Loop and Pool can be set in this configuration file but you must prefix the software with a dot as we made here. Use samples configuration files shown in github repo of each software for more options*
  
### Running LiT

Start your SSH program (eg. PuTTY) a second time, connect to the Pi and log in as ‚Äúadmin‚Äù. Commands for the second session start with the prompt $2 (which must not be entered).
We must never run LND and LiT at the same time to avoid corruption of the channels database. So we must first stop LND and its `systemd` service.

  ```sh
  $2 lncli stop
  $2 sudo systemctl stop lnd
  ```

Once everything is stopped, we can test that LiT is correctly using the LND database.

  ```sh
  $2 sudo su - bitcoin
  $2 litd
  ```

Now go back to the first session and try to unlock your wallet, if you already used your node a lot you must wait for the LND database to be open (you can take a look at the log returned in the second session where LiT is running).

  ```sh
  $ lncli unlock
  ```
  
  Type your `password [C]` to unlock the wallet. You can check the state with `lncli getinfo`, it should be synced with graph and chain. If it works, you can stop LiT running in the second section using `Ctrl + C` and exit it

  ```sh
  $2 exit
  ```
  
  
### Autostart LiT on boot

We stopped lnd service, now that LiT is running we can replace the autostart service for LND by the LiT's one. We modify LND systemd unit:

  ```sh
  $2 sudo systemctl disable lnd
  $2 sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/lnd.service
  ```
We can just change the line `ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/lnd` for `ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/litd`, rename the file and enable, start, unlock LiT:

  ```sh
  $2 sudo mv /etc/systemd/system/lnd.service /etc/systemd/system/litd.service
  $2 sudo systemctl enable litd
  $2 sudo systemctl start litd
  $2 systemctl status litd
  $2 lncli unlock
  ```
If you wish to look at the daemon information, they are in the system journal

  ```sh
  $2 sudo journalctl -f -u litd
  ```
### Using other software packaged in LiT

Others softwares have their own macaroon files too, they are created in `.loop`, `.faraday` and `.pool` directories of bitcoin home by default. So we create symbolic link so that admin user can use them.

  ```sh
  $2 ln -s /home/bitcoin/.loop /home/admin/.loop
  $2 ln -s /home/bitcoin/.pool /home/admin/.pool
  $2 ln -s /home/bitcoin/.faraday /home/admin/.faraday
  ```

For now, softwares packaged in LiT are all listening to the same port 10009 as LND. This is not the default behavior set in the code of these sofware so you must always indicate the RPC port when using them.

For example, the following will not work to look at the last auction snapshot:

  ```sh
  $2 pool auction snapshot
  ```
  
It will returns the following error:
  ```sh
  > [pool] rpc error: code = Unavailable desc = connection error: desc = "transport: Error while dialing dial tcp [::1]:12010: connect: connection refused"
  ```
It says that the `pool` command try to interact with your pool client on localhost's port 12010. However your instance of Pool is not listening to the default port 12010, but port 10009 ! It also needs to know where the TLS certificate to securely interact with LND is.

That's why this will work:

  ```sh
  $2 pool --rpcserver=localhost:10009 --tlscertpath=~/.lnd/tls.cert auction snapshot
  ```
It can be convenient to create alias to not have to type the rpc server address at every command. Use `alias` command in bash for that

  ```sh
  $2 alias poolit="pool --rpcserver=localhost:10009 --tlscertpath=~/.lnd/tls.cert"
  $2 poolit auction snapshot
  ```
You can add your aliases in `.bashrc` file of `admin`
  ```sh
  $2 nano ~/.bashrc
  ```
  
Add the following at the end of the file then save and exit:
  
  ```
  $2 alias poolit="pool --rpcserver=localhost:10009 --tlscertpath=~/.lnd/tls.cert"
  $2 alias loopit="loop --rpcserver=localhost:10009 --tlscertpath=~/.lnd/tls.cert"
  $2 alias frclit="frcli --rpcserver=localhost:10009 --tlscertpath=~/.lnd/tls.cert"
  ```
  
Use `help` and documentation on Pool, Loop and Faraday respectively for information on these command.
  
### Access LiT UI for easy Loop Out/In and Liquidity trading

LiT provides a UI that allows you to use Loop and Pool conveniently. The UI is running on port 8443. To access it you must be in your home network (or connected through a VPN like WireGuard) and `ufw` should allow access to the port 8443:

  ```sh
  $2 sudo su
  # ufw allow 8443 comment 'allow LiT UI'
  # ufw disable
  # ufw enable
  # exit
  ```
  
You can now connect from your home to `https://[your_pi_local_ip]:8443` with your browser and enjoy the nice GUI of LiT ! Use `PASSWORD_[B]` to log in.

### LiT upgrade

Open a session with "admin". You must stop LiT with `lncli stop` then `sudo systemctl stop litd` before upgrading !

Proceed as LND, but use the binaries of the LiT repo and **do not delete the LND macaroons**. Replace `wget https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd` by `wget https://github.com/lightninglabs/lightning-terminal` when downloading binaries and check signature as the "download" part of this guide.
